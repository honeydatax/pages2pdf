NAME
       mawk - pattern scanning and text processing language

SYNOPSIS
       mawk  [-W  option]  [-F value] [-v var=value] [--] 'program text' [file
       ...]
       mawk [-W option] [-F value] [-v var=value] [-f program-file] [--] [file
       ...]

DESCRIPTION
       mawk  is an interpreter for the AWK Programming Language.  The AWK lan‐
       guage is useful for manipulation of data files, text retrieval and pro‐
       cessing,  and  for prototyping and experimenting with algorithms.  mawk
       is a new awk meaning it implements the AWK language as defined in  Aho,
       Kernighan  and Weinberger, The AWK Programming Language, Addison-Wesley
       Publishing, 1988.  (Hereafter referred to as the AWK book.)  mawk  con‐
       forms  to  the Posix 1003.2 (draft 11.3) definition of the AWK language
       which contains a few features not described in the AWK book,  and  mawk
       provides a small number of extensions.

      An  AWK  program  is  a sequence of pattern {action} pairs and function
       definitions.  Short programs are entered on the  command  line  usually
       enclosed  in ' ' to avoid shell interpretation.  Longer programs can be
       read in from a file with the -f option.  Data  input is read  from  the
       list  of files on the command line or from standard input when the list
       is empty.  The input is broken into records as determined by the record
       separator  variable,  RS.  Initially, RS = "\n" and records are synony‐
       mous with lines.  Each record is compared against each pattern  and  if
       it matches, the program text for {action} is executed.

OPTIONS
       -F value       sets the field separator, FS, to value.

       -f file        Program  text is read from file instead of from the com‐
                      mand line.  Multiple -f options are allowed.

       -v var=value   assigns value to program variable var.

       --             indicates the unambiguous end of options.

       The above options will be available with any Posix compatible implemen‐
       tation  of  AWK,  and implementation specific options are prefaced with
